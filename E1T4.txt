Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Web Service Instance Role too permissive should have only GetObject permission

# Web Service Instance Role must not allow access to secret recipe bucket

# Security group for Web Service Instance should block all ports but 5000

# Security group for Web Service Instance should allow traffic in port 5000 only from specific IPS E.G.: Subnet CIDR
