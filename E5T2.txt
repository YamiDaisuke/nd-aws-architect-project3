# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

- TFSec ( https://github.com/liamg/tfsec )

### Example vulnerability

- Insecure SG allowing all ports or unrestricted IP access
- ALB with HTTP traffic enabled
- Unencrypted resources such as S3 or EBS volumes
- Public available resources

##Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

- AWS Inspector
- Anchore (https://anchore.com/)

### Example vulnerability

- Bad access policies such as SSH password login
- Outdated libraries with vulnerabilities
- Missing OS security patches for known exploits
- Package blacklists
- Presence of credentials in an image
- IAM Roles too permissive

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

- AWS Config
- Cloud Custodian (https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian)

### Example vulnerability

- Unencrypted S3 buckets
- Publicly writable S3 buckets
- Use of unapproved AMI’s
- ALB not redirect HTTP traffic to https
- IAM password policies is too weak
